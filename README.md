# Drazzard

### About
Drazzard involves you, our hero, maintaining control of the dungeon for as long as possible.  Enemies will continually spawn with more health, damage, speed, and wit, and it's up to you to survive!  The game provides powerups in the form of a shop system, along with random spawns throughout the map.  Spend your points wisely to ensure you have the tools to reach a higher level than ever before!  The game is very much still in active development, and will remain open source for anyone who wants to use/modify the code, or simply play the game.

### Details
The game is written entirely in [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) and utilizes the [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) framework.
